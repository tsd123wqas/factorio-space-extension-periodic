# Summary
SpaceX Fork - greatly extends the end game requiring multiple launches, massively increased science and item production.

The aim of this mod is to provide a significantly longer end game experience. Instead of requiring a single satellite launch, you will now require a few hundred launches with a variety of new components. The goal now is no longer to simply launch a satellite, but to build a vessel capable of getting you off the planet and home safely. In addition to building components for your spacecraft, you will need to vastly increase your science in order to research all the required components. In fact, regardless of how much science you have built already, I pretty much guarantee that it will not be enough! Science is one of the best on-going consumers of resources, and so it is to this end that researching the technologies for a spacecraft is a truly massive scientific undertaking.

# Features
- Provides a significantly longer end game experience
- Gives you a goal to launch way more rockets
- Adds new technology which require a lot of science packs
- Adds new items which require a lot of other items
- Requires your factory to grow even more to be able to have enough resources for researching and building the spacecraft
